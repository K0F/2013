Kof's sketchbook year 2013

The sketches are organized by month of year. This structure can make a feel of kind of organization, which in fact is false, it is rather mess with all ideas and unfinished concepts placed in kind of plain time-line space. Feel free to dig in and recycle anything useful for you.. when you find something like this, feel free to contact me, I would be really happy to see if anything can be somehow useful / helpful for the others.

Sketches Running Online
-----------------------

There is a kind of selection hosted on [Open Processing](http://www.openprocessing.org/user/3942), these are mostly kind of "obsolete" Java applets selected for being able to run in a browser.

Rendered Outputs
----------------

Other way of online presentation is just online quite heavily re-compressed (mpeg4) videos, they are more widely accepted due to more standard media form. The most of these outputs are available on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/kof/videos).

Enjoy, and feel free to recycle!
