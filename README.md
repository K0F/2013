Kof's sketchbook year 2013

The sketches are organized by month of year. This structure can make a feel of a superior organization, which in fact is false, it is rather mess with all ideas and unfinished concepts placed in kind of plain time-line space. Feel free to dig in and recycle anything useful for you.. when you find something like this, feel free to contact me, I would be really happy to see if anything can be somehow useful / helpful for the others.

Sketches Running Online
-----------------------

There is a kind of selection hosted on [Open Processing](http://www.openprocessing.org/user/3942), these are mostly a bit "obsolete" Java applets selected for being able to run in a browser.

Rendered Outputs
----------------

Other way of online presentation is just online quite heavily re-compressed (mpeg4) videos, they are more widely accepted due to more standard media form. The most of these outputs are available on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/kof/videos).

Archival Bits and Pieces
------------------------

If you really feel like digging, there are more historical "pieces". To travel back in time in repositories:

* [2012](https://github.com/K0F/2012)
* [2011](https://github.com/K0F/2011)
* [2010](https://github.com/K0F/2010)
* [2009](https://github.com/K0F/2009)
* [2008](https://github.com/K0F/2008)
* [2007](https://github.com/K0F/2007)

But please, remember you had been warned, there is plenty of nearly autistic mental production with very varying "qualities" .. to be more exact, some of them are complete waste of time to run or even compile ))


Enjoy, and feel free to recycle!
