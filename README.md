Kof's sketchbook year 2013

The sketches are organized by month of year. This sructure can make a feel of kind of organization, which in fact is false, it is rather mess with all ideas and unfinished concepts placed in conceptual timeline. Feel free to dig in and recycle anything useful for you.. if you find something like this, feel free to contact me, I would be really happy to see if anything can be somehow helpful for the others.
